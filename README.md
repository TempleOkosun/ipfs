ipfs project

The objective of this project is to develop a Dapp for hosting files.<br>

Making it harder for files to disappear from the web and easier for others to access it, <br> 
retrieving the file from a closer person who has it. <br>

If someone else tries to upload the same file it will generate the same hash and thus we avoid duplicates on the network. 
<br> We don't clutter the network. <br>

File storage for each account: When the user account is changed through meta-mask, 
<br> the files the currently selected users have will be loaded on the page. <br>


Uploaded files for an account: 
<br> The hash, type and date of uploaded file will be stored in a smart contract. <br>

Tools:<br>
React,
Truffle,
Ganache,
Meta-mask

Work in progress.
